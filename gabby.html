		<p>During this semester, students got the opportunity to interact with a variety of professionals who in-depth shared their definitions of architectural practices. Their design solutions and approaches showed how skills such as; communication and the right attitude can lead to generating optimistic interdisciplinary change. The vast range of exposure to well-established speakers and their ways of thinking was mind-boggling, especially the reinforced idea of how crucial it is to think critically and advocate for change not only in architecture but also within local communities. The social-cultural aspect is considerable to understand to make a difference as a collective.

		<p>Each speaker brought ideas that I will try to impart in my way of thinking about the practice. Nonetheless, there are a few architects whose knowledge left a mark on me and the way I enter the industry in the future. One of them is Stephanie Sang Delgado and her philosophy regarding architectural organizations and the process behind obtaining a license. Stephanie raised a valid question about what it means to be an architect nowadays and how some institutions tend to act multiculturally sensitive while having an insufficient organizational structure. Her non-filtered opinions made me start asking questions about the intentions behind renowned associations that claim to improve public prosperity. Currently, there is a fair amount of controversy behind the American Institute of Architects management. By profiting from membership fees, practicing inclusiveness, and discrimination, the organization absence of healthful ideas. Subsequently, the AIA holds on to regurgitate policies that do not bring communities closer through design. Instead, the system creates a political sham to look righteous for the bigger audience. Formulating "beautiful promises' ' does not bring changes to neighborhoods nor tackle the climate change issue. Sometimes actions speak louder than words which the organization should concentrate on to reverse cumbersome effects. Alongside the licensure process information, I will not associate myself with the AIA organization as a way of worldmaking. Preferably, I try to research organizations beforehand to get as much as possible to be aware of the advantages and disadvantages. By having solid professional properties, architects can focus on making authentic changes. Stephanie was an exceptional advocacy example where you do not have to be politically correct all the time to make a change or climb the career ladder.

		<p>Another guest lecturer who makes an impression on me is Johnny Leva from the Traumnovelle practice. His way of thinking resonated with me particularly, the part of being optimistic and cynical towards architecture. What struck me about Johnny was his positivism, and speaking his mind on the good and bad sides of professional practice. Depicted firm's projects felt almost like there was a deep consideration of how to conceive spaces a better place so that people who will occupy them can enjoy human interaction. Even the straightforward design approach presents sets of challenging aspects that architects need to face, which is why Traumnovelle creates design scenarios by using metaphor as a form for open interpretation. This point of view provides a flexible prompt to something abstracting yet exciting within a space.  
As architects are surrounded by an immense amount of information, I got the impression that it is important to ask questions about the end goal of a project. That is to say, what is the design intention and how it correlates to history, traditions, and social stratification. What I will incorporate into my practice is the intention behind the design about which Jonny talked. I think this idea of understating spaces on a deeper level has a great value in creating relationships and a sense of wellbeing and productivity. I would also challenge myself to start incorporating diverse forms of speech as part of the design process.

		<p>Lastly, I cherished how Cruz and Nathalie designed the class, where they openly called out things that the industry is concealing. Both focused on encouraging students to think outside the box and do not take no for an answer.  Further, having the full support of professors and guest lecturers to freely engage and ask questions even the „dumb” ones, allowed students to get a broader perspective of what the field holds for the present, future, and its relationship to the past. The format of the class further acknowledged current social issues along with students’ interests. This class brought light to many aspects such as activism, racism, and climate change. One of my takeaways from this course will be able to advocate for myself and be able to be actively involved in social change and questioning the existing things and their true purposes.
