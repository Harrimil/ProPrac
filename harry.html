      <h4> Ilze and Heinrich Wolff </h4>
    <p> Part of Ilze and Heinrich’s practice involves the act of teaching. They approach this idea of teaching from various ways such as creating pamphlets to quickly spread messages throughout the community, art workshops with children, and workshops discussing the future of architecture education and how to incorporate activism into new curriculums. Heinrich has also been hosted by various universities to educate students from around the world about urbanism and the importance of using discretion when it comes to project briefs. On top of this, they also host exhibitions within their place of work that focus on various art forms revolving around South Africa. I found it fascinating how even though they are not teachers or involved with educational institutions by trade, they still find it important to get their messages out and play an active role in educating the community around them.

       Ilze and Heinrich’s architectural practice focuses on the story of the buildings, the research behind them, and what they were trying to accomplish, rather than the end point and the completed project that many other practices tend to focus on. Ilze and Heinrich emphasize how the physical building is only the last step of a very long process analyzing the history and the environment of a site. For example, they did deep physical research including LiDAR scanning of a site with the intent of having the building be as unintrusive to a site as possible. On another site, they were working with photographers to get better ideas of the social aspects of that area. I admire the amount of thought that Ilze and Heinrich put into their work and how they don’t just create buildings but create buildings that serve a deeper social purpose or attend to its history.

      <h4> Office CA </h4>
      <p> One of the main things that stuck with me from the lecture series was the different ways that Office CA uses technology in its practice. I thought it was interesting to see the work that the firm did was not limited to buildings and they focused on technology and alternative designing tools that architects could use in the future. The firm has developed various special web apps that provide new insights into space within the virtual realm. I am interested in programming on top of architecture and was excited to see a firm lean towards this merging of the two.

      <h4> Fernando Abruna </h4>
      <p>Fernando Abruna’s practice focuses on creating sustainable buildings. I thought it was interesting to see how one approaches sustainable and low energy projects in a tropical climate, compared to ones in temperate climates that we are used to. It seems like in tropical climates it is not as important to have buildings completely separated from the outside and it was fascinating to see how Abruna incorporates almost every natural phenomenon, sunlight, rainwater, wind, and gravity, into his work to create completely functional buildings. I feel like a lot of people view buildings as almost this shield from the outside world, but almost all of Fernando’s works incorporated the outside directly into the building. I really appreciate his approach to designing sustainable and beautiful buildings because so often one is heavily prioritized over the other. I am very interested on mitigating the environmental effects of buildings and creating sustainable architecture and I think that Fernando Abruna is someone that has achieved these aspirations very well.

      <h4> The Future </h4>
      <p> From Ilze and Heinrich Wolff I can take away putting in that extra effort in the early stages of a project to really focus on an issue and get a deeper context of the site and social situations surrounding it. I am also curious to see if there is a way to shine light on the deeper meanings behind works of architecture because for the most part the average person will have no idea. Additionally, I think it would be interesting to host workshops while I am practicing in the future and get extra community involvement in the design process.
	<br>From Office CA I like the idea of incorporating technology and programming into architecture and would like to see if I can do something with coding and design for my thesis next year.
	<br>From Fernando Abruna I have learned a lot about passive strategies and being able to greatly reduce the environmental impact of buildings. In design I would like to take some of these ideas and push my buildings further into being sustainable. The building sector uses up so much of the world’s energy so I would like to help mitigate that in any way I can when designing buildings.
