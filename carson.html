   <p>Vernacular architecture responds to climate, flora, fauna, territory, food production, and traditional uses and customs of local culture, meeting core human needs. The construction of these assemblies builds mutual aid and transfers knowledge within communities and their surroundings. There is no autonomous architect, as the act of making is a participatory social process steeped in communal effort.
Understanding the local environment and culture is necessary when building vernacular assemblies. Communal Taller collaborates with indigenous Mexican communities to understand rather than impose on vernacular ways of living. This is achieved through community-oriented architecture where research and a local understanding is fundamental. Participatory maps and models created by residents of these communities share knowledge of the local social structure as well as an understanding of the local environment. Communal is an instrument through which indigenous communities are given autonomy through each phase of a project. According to Jesica Carrera, one of Communal’s founders, this refreshing approach to architecture allows for the creation of living and evolving architecture that is generated by the surrounding community.

   <p>Respecting the environment and the local vernacular, Communal sources local and traditional materials as well as utilizing local construction knowledge. This is something that particularly interests me as I look to start a practice. It is essential that architects begin to consider embodied energy in buildings, as construction emits nearly 40% of global carbon emissions.1 I believe sourcing local materials is a starting point to lower these numbers, as it will decrease transportation emissions. There are lessons to be learned from Communal and how they understood housing in Oaxaca, Mexico. Understanding the desire to preserve traditional housing, Communal worked with Oaxaca residents to develop structural improvements to the local adobe brick vernacular. Since the material is familiar to local residents, they are able to make the bricks themselves without outsourcing material. </p>

   <p> I am interested in how my practice could replicate this process in the United States, particularly in communities across Appalachia. I would model this by implementing community oriented design through activities such as participatory mapping and models, where residents are active in every step of the design process. Rather than intruding on the community, the practice will seek to give autonomy to the locals. Developing a pamphlet similar to Communal’s Self-Build manual, the practice would inform locals on how to sustainably build without imposing on the local construction knowledge and materials. The practice would ultimately seek to serve impoverished communities in Appalachia through listening, understanding, and speaking to the inhabitants.
