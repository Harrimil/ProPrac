		<p>The past several years have seen the beginning of a social reckoning in the United States. Several questions are starting to be asked about the type of society people want to live in and be a part of. Several topics and ideas that were once widely considered acceptable are now being questioned. It has become clear that racism in America runs deep. Many laws and policies inadvertently exclude or put minorities at a disadvantage. Racism has such a long and prevalent history in America that it is engrained in the culture. Because of this, the culture itself has to be reexamined and reconfigured to better accommodate everyone.

		<p>The goal of the 1Hood is to tackle these issues on a city-wide and neighborhood-wide scale. Many neighborhoods and communities do not have a way to voice concerns or communicate their needs. As a result, they become misrepresented in the media, and they do not receive the help or resources that they need. In addition, the media’s portrayal of certain communities can influence how that community is treated in society and can lead to prejudice and hate. 1Hood is using art and design to start conversations and give these communities a platform. The organization also helps give people who already create art for a living a louder voice. Through workshops and collaborations, these artists can express themselves and share their ideas about social justice and representation. 1Hood originated in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, but this model can be used in other cities and marginalized places.

		<p>This lecture was meaningful to me and made me consider my own design process. Architecture plays a role in social discourse, and it influences people’s behaviors and actions. Therefore, architecture has a responsibility to provide communities with the tools they need. For example, neighborhoods need a community center or a space for meetings and workshops, or a place for people to go to learn about other communities or to simply meet people. All buildings that are designed should be accessible to all and should play a part in a society that is accessible to all.
