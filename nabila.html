		<h4> MAD Architects</h4>

		<p>MAD Architects heavily focuses on the interaction between nature and architecture. They believe that they can minimize the impact of architecture in the city by exploring dynamic shapes. By doing this, architecture becomes integrated into the landscape since most of the architecture in the city is orthogonal with sharp edges. The point of their architecture work is to blur the lines between the interior and exterior. They want to bring the interior to the exterior and bring the exterior to the interior. Andrea D’Antrassi mentioned that sustainability elements should be integrated into the architecture and modified according to different factors of the building. Also, he explained that architects need to develop how they integrate architecture with the landscape.

		<p>Andrea brought up many good points that we, as future architects, can learn and integrate into our profession. An innovative way to bring sustainability aspects to architecture is by focusing on the interaction of nature and building. Many cities are dense and filled with buildings. By bringing in natural elements, it is good for our well-being, but also the environment. This has been a recent effort in the architecture field with green roofs/facades, bioretention swales, parks, etc. In addition, there have been new areas of design, such as biomimicry and biophilia that explore this interaction. This is a type of design work that I like to explore since we can learn a lot from nature. However, this should not be a temporary trend in the architecture field. It should be a way we approach architecture from now on to prevent global warming.

		<h4>Fernando Abruña</h4>

		<p>Fernando Abruña is a Puerto Rican architect whose drive and passion in life is sustainable design work. He explained that sustainability is not an afterthought. It is something to be taken into account throughout the building's design process. It was clear that sustainability drives his design work. It was amazing seeing the amount of effort and thought he puts into each of his projects. His portfolio ranges from buildings to products. In his work, he makes sure to allow nature to become part of his architecture. In the end, he advised us to go beyond the accepted sustainability criteria that are put in place and be innovative with sustainable design work.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>As future architects, we can learn a lot from him and his efforts. He has made great architecture while focusing on sustainability. I will bring his same drive into my studio work through innovation, siting, equity, etc. Additionally, I will explore natural sustainability aspects, such as passive cooling in my design work and allowing nature to become a part of the architecture. Future and current architects must have Abruña’s drive because climate change is a critical issue that can not be optional and thought about after the design process.
